### What is here?
- This repository makes available the environment that can be use to reproduce the experimental results described in the paper.

### Folders:

#### docker

#### profiling
- Constains proling files obtained from GPU executions with *nvprof* tool, as well as R files to process and generate charts from them.

#### results
- Constains data from the results of the executions on the platform and a R file to generate charts from it.
